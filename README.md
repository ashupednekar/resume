## Summary
Senior Software Architect with a strong focus on backend development, distributed systems, and Rust-based solutions.  
I have experience designing scalable and resilient systems, working with high-throughput pub/sub systems, and building backend tools that align with modern infrastructure needs.  
I believe in working on craft-oriented problems that emphasize correctness, simplicity, and maintainability. I enjoy leading teams that share a commitment to building thoughtful, scalable systems that are a joy to work on.  
Currently focused on low-level systems programming, functional programming principles, and distributed systems design.

## Experience
### Affinsys AI  
**Senior Software Architect**  
*2021 – Present*  

- Designed and developed high-throughput task scheduling systems and pub/sub infrastructures using NATS for distributed task execution.  
- Worked on creating backend services for scalable, event-driven architectures with real-time observability and tracing.  
- Led initiatives for containerized microservices architecture using Kubernetes, ensuring robust deployment and scaling strategies.  
- Contributed to the adoption of a Rust-first backend stack, improving performance and reducing memory overhead in critical systems.  
- Focused on building internal tools and infrastructure that align with DevOps principles, ensuring smooth continuous integration and deployment.
- worked on natural language stuff back in the day

## Open Source & Personal work 

- **liteginx**: reverse proxy for http routrd and tcp streams written in rust
- **litefunctions**: my take on lambda functions, essentially a kubernetes operator managing cd, http ingestor and runtimes for various languages
- **websocketstream**: stateless websocket ingestor, scaling websockets with persitent pubsub
- **standard-error**: a simple crate that makes it easier for axum applications to do well defined errors with most from traits built in
- **quickgrpc**: this is an old one, makes it simple to build gRPC servers in python, sorta like tonic does today, abstracting the protoc tooling 
- implemented raft leader election from scratch

## Upcoming projects
- tls terminarion support to liteginx
- gRPC transcoding to openapi spec/ pubsub topics, mostly as a feature to liteginx
- look into ferron for oss contributions
- litedb, maybe a distributed sqlite with hashicorp raft library
- liteobjects, this one's in progress, looking into object dtore internals


I've documented most of my projects in my blog
