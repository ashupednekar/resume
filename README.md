## Summary
Senior Software Architect with a strong focus on backend development, distributed systems, and Rust-based solutions.  
I have experience designing scalable and resilient systems, working with high-throughput pub/sub systems, and building backend tools that align with modern infrastructure needs.  
I believe in working on craft-oriented problems that emphasize correctness, simplicity, and maintainability. I enjoy leading teams that share a commitment to building thoughtful, scalable systems that are a joy to work on.  
Currently focused on low-level systems programming, functional programming principles, and distributed systems design.
